/**
 * IndexResponse represents the structure of the response body from an Elasticsearch index operation API.
 * It provides information about the success of the indexing operation, including shard details,
 * index metadata, document identification, versioning, and the result of the operation.
 *
 * Documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/docs-index_.html
 *
 * @interface IndexResponse
 * @property {Object} _shards - Information about the replication process of the index operation.
 * @property {number} _shards.total - Indicates how many shard copies (primary and replica shards) the index operation should be executed on.
 * @property {number} _shards.successful - Indicates the number of shard copies the index operation succeeded on.
 * @property {number} _shards.failed - An array that contains replication-related errors in the case an index operation failed on a replica shard.
 *                                      0 indicates there were no failures.
 * @property {string} _index - The name of the index the document was added to.
 * @property {string} _type - The document type. Elasticsearch indices now support a single document type, _doc.
 * @property {string} _id - The unique identifier for the added document.
 * @property {number} _version - The document version. Incremented each time the document is updated.
 * @property {number} _seq_no - The sequence number assigned to the document for the indexing operation.
 *                             Sequence numbers are used to ensure an older version of a document doesnâ€™t overwrite a newer version.
 *                             See Optimistic concurrency control.
 * @property {number} _primary_term - The primary term assigned to the document for the indexing operation.
 *                                    See Optimistic concurrency control.
 * @property {'created' | 'updated'} result - The result of the indexing operation, indicating whether the document was created or updated.
